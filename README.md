# UnityUtils

A collection of use full unity classes that I use in most of my projects

## Explination

The scripts are devided in two folders. Classes and Utils. The scripts in utils are static and you can just use it by calling the `classname.function()`. The scripts in classes are not static so they need to be declared like objects. For example `ClassName classname = new ClassName()`.
